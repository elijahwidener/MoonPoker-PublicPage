## Project Overview

MoonPoker is a modern poker platform designed to provide a high-performance, low-latency poker experience. The project features a modular architecture with a C++ game engine core, networked gameplay capabilities, and a cross-platform Flutter client. Our design focuses on performance, scalability, and clean separation of concerns.

## Technical Architecture

MoonPoker employs a layered architecture:

### Core Game Engine (C++)
- **High-performance** poker logic implementation
- **Deterministic evaluation** of poker hands
- **Constant-time** operations for critical path functions
- **Memory-efficient** state management

### Network Layer (C++ with gRPC)
- **Server implementation** with concurrent game management
- **Real-time communication** for gameplay events
- **Secure authentication** system
- **Game state synchronization** with optimized protocols

### Client Application (Flutter/Dart)
- **Cross-platform** support (Web, iOS, Android)
- **Responsive UI** design for different screen sizes
- **State management** with modern reactive patterns
- **Offline capabilities** for practice play

### Web Services (JavaScript)
- **Lobby system** for game discovery and joining
- **User account management** with authentication
- **Social features** including friends and messaging
- **Tournament management** for competitive play
- **RESTful API** for client-server communication

## Repository Structure

The project is organized into separate repositories for each major component:

- **moonpoker-engine**: C++ game core and poker logic
- **moonpoker-client**: Flutter-based cross-platform client
- **moonpoker-lobby**: JavaScript-based lobby and user management including authentication

This separation allows specialized teams to work on different components using the most appropriate technology for each domain.

## Current Status

### Completed Components:
- âœ… Core poker game engine (Texas Hold'em)
